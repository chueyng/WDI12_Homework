<!-- Movies I
Specification

Build a search form that lets the user enter a movie name. The Sinatra app will use HTTParty to fetch the data for the chosen movie from OMDB and display it on the page. Display the poster, as a bare minimum.

Bonus I

Modify your existing code to allow searches for multiple matches. For example, a search for "Alien" should return a list of clickable links (each of which would then take you to the full results page for the selected movie):

Alien
Aliens
Alien 3
Alien Resurrection
My Stepmother Is An Alien
etc
The OMDB site documents the parameter you need to use to search for multiple matches.

Bonus II

Update your code from bonus I so that if only one movie matches your search you are forwarded directly to that movie's result page.
